        <div id="para">The Uber Verdante is the ultimate choice of premium luxury apartments where you can lead a peaceful and calm life while not missing out on the fun of living in a metro city like Bengaluru. The location, design and development of this category of apartments are such that you are just at a stone’s throw away from all the city attractions like the most sought after companies, popular educational institutions, sophisticated healthcare facilities and entertainment centres. On the other hand, nature-inspired green homes will keep you connected with nature</div>

        <div id="fpara">Mana Foresta is a 14 storey Vertical Forest Tower, with homes covered in greenery and presenting a forest-like environment, that brings together experts in botany, sustainability and ecology to create a radical project that revolutionizes the concept of living space. 

            This is a residential tower not covered in metal, but in leaves, shrubs, trees and creepers. This is a perfect home for people looking to stay away from the hustle of crowded city life. A perfect home with plenty of trees and shrubs around, you can enjoy the company of nature at its greenest form here in these houses. The best part of it is that you do not have to travel away from the city as these homes are located well within Bengaluru city.</div>

        <div id="cpara">At Mana Capitol, you can live the life you desire. With café, restaurants, open seating areas and expansive gardens that are Wi-Fi enabled, you can work from anywhere. With multiple recreational facilities, you can break away from a monotonous routine anytime. With minimum vehicular movement inside the premise, you can cycle to and from your workplace. With community spaces in the vicinity, you can catch-up and bond with people and lead a wholesome life. 

            However, the most important factor of Mana Capitol is the convertible homes - one of a kind in Bengaluru. When we say convertible, it, literally, is convertible as you can transform your bedroom into a work area or your drawing room into a party area by pushing the flexible walls to create space as per your needs.</div>
